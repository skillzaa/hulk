    <h1>The Rust Book Ch 10 Traits Summary</h1>
<h3>Definitions / Explanation</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>#myview</strong> Trait is just like <strong>interface</strong> in other languages with some super powers. Just like an interface its main / basic job is to present one or more function signatures. This interface is then implemented by various Types.</li>
<li>A trait can also contain default implementation of some or all of the methods it presents. The user can accept the default implementation or can over-ride it. The methods for which the trait does not provide default implementation the user has to provide.</li>
<li>Once a type / user implements a trait it has to provide implementation for those methods for which the trait has not provided a default implementation.</li>
</ol>
