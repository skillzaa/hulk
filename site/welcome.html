<p>In the Name of Allah Most Merciful.</p>
<ul>
<li>I have started this new project to write about Rust Programming language.</li>
<li>Hopefully I will continue this project for a very long time. (20-Oct-2021) <strong>I promise my-self that I will not move this project from its current plateform i.e mdBook and github</strong>.</li>
<li>These are my notes which I created while learning and coding Rust language. It has code snippets , images , explanations, rants and everthing that I wrote while learning rust.</li>
<li>Consider this as a <strong>quick and dirty -- but -- detailed</strong> sort of a work. I expect there to be many mistakes and errors and hope that you will bring them to my attention.</li>
<li>There will be rough notes (they are like scrambling) please dont waste your time on those.</li>
<li>God bless you.</li>
</ul>
