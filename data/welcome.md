In the Name of Allah Most Merciful.
-   I have started this new project to write about Rust Programming language. 
-   Hopefully I will continue this project for a very long time. (20-Oct-2021) **I promise my-self that I will not move this project from its current plateform i.e mdBook and github**. 
-   These are my notes which I created while learning and coding Rust language. It has code snippets , images , explanations, rants and everthing that I wrote while learning rust.
- Consider this as a **quick and dirty -- but -- detailed** sort of a work. I expect there to be many mistakes and errors and hope that you will bring them to my attention.
- There will be rough notes (they are like scrambling) please dont waste your time on those.
-   God bless you.
